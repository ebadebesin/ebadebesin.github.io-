    <h2 style="color:rgb(71, 6, 124);">Quick and Simple Bio About Me</h2>
    

    <p>

        <br>
        My name is Ebunoluwa Blessing Adebesin, but most times I go by Blessing. 
        I am a junior majoring in Computer science with a minor in Mathematics at Huston Tillotson University, which is the first HBCU in Austin, Texas.
        I love Computer Science and the broad opportunities it has to offer! I'm not sure what exactly I want to do but I hope to use my degree to bring 
        technology closer to the less priviledge. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite thing about studying Computer Science is the vast opportunities and careers in the field. My goal is definitely to work
        in a field that allows me to actively inact changes, be it just in bug fixes or designing a website or software, I want to work where I see my work and the effects it has on the company and the customers.  
    </p> 
        <br>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

    </p>
        <br>
        I am an avid learner, a team player and creative leader who has an interest to pursue a career in the Tech field, because I want to be adaptable 
        and thrive in an atmosphere that is always developing and intellectually stimulating.

        <br>
        When I'm not conquering the world, I love to travel, go on adventures, cook and try new recipes, read, crochet, sleep and more. 
        I have a new found interest in painting which I use most times to de-stress.
